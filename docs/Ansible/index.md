# Ansible

Ansible is a neat way of automating the routine tasks of maintaining a number of computers.

I started with ansible a few years ago but it got very complicated with two houses and a bunch of travel.
Recently, we sold our summer home which greatly simplefies the location of the various computers.

Also, I decided to set up a container system to keep things available and fault tolerant.
