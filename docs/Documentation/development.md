# Development

I have several development computers.
Keeping them updated is a pain since they run different Linux distributions.

## Code editing

I used to use emacs but also learned vi.
Later on I discovered Eclipse and switched to using it.
Now I have discovered Visual Studio Code and am switching to it.
VS seems to be the most natural to me and has a lot of the things I use already integrated.
It also seems more natural than Eclipse.

## MkDocs

This documentation is created using MkDocs.
The software is loaded on some of the development computers.

Run the following to load the documentation software.

``` bash
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-plugin
pip install mkdocs-material
```
