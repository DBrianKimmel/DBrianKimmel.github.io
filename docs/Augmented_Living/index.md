# Augmented Living

In the USA and perhaps other places as well, Assisted Living is a place you go near the end of your life.

So I use the term Augmented living to describe what a smart house helps you do.

Instead of just automating the house, I believe the house should provide a lot more.

Your house should know what it is that you want or need and provide it to you.
You should not need to tell the house either by voice or changing the thermostat setting that it is too cold or too hot.
If you like it cooler to sleep and you lie down in a bed somewhere in your house, that room should get or at least feel cooler.

If you go into the bathroom at night while you are watching TV, the lights should illuminate your path and the bathroom.
But, if you go the bathroom after being in bed, only the low illumination of night lights is needed.
